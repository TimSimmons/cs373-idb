<h1>Models<h1>

<h4>There are 5 models</h4> 

<p><strong>Player and Player_Year</strong>
   <ol>The Player model serves as somewhat of a parent class to the Player_Year model. Each Player model contains information about an individual player which remains persistent throughout a player's career. For example, a player's name, school and handedness are contained in this model. The Player_Year model holds information about a player which is likely to change from year to year. For example, any yearly statistics such as batting average or the team the player played for that specific year would be attributes of this model.
   </ol>
   <ol>
     To establish a link between the Player and Player_Years models, we include in the Player_Year model a ForeignKey to a Player model. This establishes a many to one relationship from Player_Years to Player. Django automatically maintains the backwards relation from Player to Player_Year. Using the option 'related_name' of the ForeignKey, we specify a meaningful name for the backwards relation which allows us to retrieve all Player_Years from a Player. 
     <ol>
     Example:
        <ol>
            Player_Year(model):
            <ol>
                player = ForeignKey(Player, related_name='player_years')
            </ol>   
       </ol>
     </ol>
     Now from an instance of a Player model, <code>player_instance</code>, we can get all Player_Years which have that Player's key as a ForeignKey field with <code>player_instance.player_years</code>
    </ol>




<p><strong>Team and Team_Year</strong>
   	<ol>
The Team and Team_Year models are represented in the same way as the Player and Player_Year models, with the Team_Year model containing an ForeignKey field which links to a Team model.
